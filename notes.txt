flask
jinja



Flask migration is used to update the database table inbetween 




#flask db init 
--> initialize the migrations folder 
--> only used once







user will come to login 

if user exists :
    if password match:
        dashboard
    else:
        incorrect password message
else:
    signup:
        if username that usrr has entered already exists:
                dont allow to register
        else:
                register and go to login



We need to make sure that we have a by default 1 admin inside the user table already whenever we 
start the application

we should have at least 1 user as is_admin = true
